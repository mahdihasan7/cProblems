I created this repository as a sort of learning how github works and how to push files from pc directory to github using git. Algorithm exercise contains problems i solved during my c programming lessons. I was frustated because i couldn't solve any problmes without the help of chatgpt. I couldn't even break down problmes into psedocode. Then i searched for some beginner problmes to try. And found a website that has simple problems that challenges various understanding. I think that helped a lot because i was being able to solve problems without help. Got out of my frustration and could simplify a problem into small psedocode. Nobody learns C at this level in 2024 but i will continue to learn because it's fun.
